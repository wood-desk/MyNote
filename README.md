# The esp32 is a very good and very powerful mcu. I use it to make a lot of things. Like the "Little dinosaur" , "Cloud disk" ... But the best things I make by ESP32 is this! ---> "MyNote". It is a Event reminder with the very cheep Eink screen. This screen can display 3 colors. --> Black Red White. And I start a esp32 wifi mesh with a httpserver on it. It is very easy to make.

## Build the ESP32 arduino environment
#### Do you need the very cheep ESP core board?Just buy it [here](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=618006256099)!
#### You may meet a lot of problems. But I can help you to solve them. Just E-mail me at joey.deng617@gmail.com
### ps: If you have the ESP32 arduino environment. You can skip this step.

    
#### But i hope you can finish reading this chapter. Because there are many problems in common ESP32 library.

I use this ``` https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json ```ESP32 library.
I am using version 1.0.6, which is the only version I have tested successfully! ![image](https://i.ibb.co/QjWcVYP/2021-08-28-10-35-05.png)

After that you can choose yours board from Tools > Board.
## Install the ```painlessMesh``` library
Install this library from Tools > Manage Libraries.
Then a pop-up window is displayed
Just select "install all" to install associated library
